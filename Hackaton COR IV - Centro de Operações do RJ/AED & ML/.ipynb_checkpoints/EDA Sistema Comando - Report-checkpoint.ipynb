    "    1. Work with pre-defined points of interest. It can be 2D grid based area sections, street sections (number intervals), or historical polygon area sections. Obs: Incidents' location distribution on the map suggests the use of street sections, as many streets have multiple incidents along limited sections.\n",
    "    1. Predict binary probability/class (yes, no) or multinomial probability/class (low, medium, high chance of ocorrence). Predict for each point of interest, each time for a defined frequency.\n",
    "    2. Choose prediction frequency based on the highest real time variable frequency. If the frequency of this variable is one observation every 15 min, train the model using 15 min spread samples, repeating the values of less frequently observed variables.\n",
    "    3. Train model on time series of ocorrences (repeating datetime values such as date, week, month) + other realtime and fixed variables.\n",
    "    4. Limit time scope of the model to some arbitrary rules, for example:\n",
    "        1. Only if its raining above X  milimeters, after Y minutes or hours, on a pluviometric station Z meters far from each city point of interest. Model is only trained for data in this circunstances and only makes real time predictions under these circunstances. This can help reduce the imbalance issue.\n",
    "        2. If we have real time rain geometry data, only train/predict if rain is X meters close, for Y hours, above Z rain intensity, etc. Examples of rain geometry data: Rain center, shape, speed magnitude and direction, intensity and intensity rate, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Recommendation for feature engineering:\n",
    "    1. mm of rain in previous X, Y and Z hours for stations under A, B and C distances of each point of interest (similar to the data used by the arbitrary rule explained).\n",
    "    2. Input the forecast of time series models of incident ocorrence, to the actual model of real time ocorrence risk. That is, make predictions of how many incidents are expected each day, week or month, and input these to the risk model.\n",
    "    3. If real time rain geometry data is available, compute distances to stations and points of interest, as well as rain tendency prediction, such as increasing, decreasing, speeding up, etc  (also similar to the data used by the arbitrary rule explained).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Asses previous built models of the same problem. It was discussed in mentorship sections with professional and specialists that previous studies and attemps to model the incidents have been performed by the COR-Rio and other institutions. Besides, apperently, there are current efforts from different institutions to include or collect additional data, and to facilitate the development and implementation of this modeling solution."
